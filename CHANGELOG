## Changes from ASTP 0.0.1 to 1.0.0

### Host OSAL

- Bugfix in MessageQueue, which caused the sender not to be set properly

### FreeRTOS OSAL

- vRequestContextSwitchFromISR is declared extern "C" so it can be defined in
a C file without issues

### PUS Services

- It is now possible to change the message queue depth for the telecommand verification service (PUS1)
- The same is possible for the event reporting service (PUS5)
- PUS Health Service added, which allows to command and retrieve health via PUS packets

### Internal Error Reporter

- The new internal error reporter uses the local data pools. The pool IDs for
the exisiting three error values and the new error set will be hardcoded for
now, the the constructor for the internal error reporter just takes an object
ID for now.
