## Changes from ASTP 0.0.1 to 1.0.0

### Host OSAL

- Bugfix in MessageQueue, which caused the sender not to be set properly

### FreeRTOS OSAL

- vRequestContextSwitchFromISR is declared extern "C" so it can be defined in
a C file without issues

### PUS Services

- It is now possible to change the message queue depth for the telecommand verification service (PUS1)
- The same is possible for the event reporting service (PUS5)
- PUS Health Service added, which allows to command and retrieve health via PUS packets

### Parameter Service

- The API of the parameter service has been changed to prevent inconsistencies
between documentation and actual code and to clarify usage.
- The parameter ID now consists of:
	1. Domain ID (1 byte)
	2. Unique Identifier (1 byte)
	3. Linear Index (2 bytes)
The linear index can be used for arrays as well as matrices.
The parameter load command now explicitely expects the ECSS PTC and PFC
information as well as  the rows and column number. Rows and column will
default to one, which is equivalent to one scalar parameter (the most
important use-case)
   
### Internal Error Reporter

- The new internal error reporter uses the local data pools. The pool IDs for
the exisiting three error values and the new error set will be hardcoded for
now, the the constructor for the internal error reporter just takes an object
ID for now.

### Device Handler Base

- There is an additional `PERFORM_OPERATION` step for the device handler base. It is important
that DHB users adapt their polling sequence tables to perform this step. This steps allows for aclear distinction between operation and communication steps

### Events

- makeEvent function: Now takes three input parameters instead of two and
allows setting a unique ID. Event.cpp source file removed, functions now
defined in header directly. Namespaces renamed. Functions declared `constexpr`
now
