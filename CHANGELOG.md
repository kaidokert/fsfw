## Changes

- Renamed auto-formatting script to `auto-formatter.sh` and made it more robust.
  If `cmake-format` is installed, it will also auto-format the `CMakeLists.txt` files now.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/625
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/626
- Bump C++ required version to C++17. Every project which uses the FSFW and every modern
  compiler supports it
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/622
- HAL Linux SPI: Set the Clock Default State when setting new SPI speed
  and mode
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/573
- GPIO HAL: `Direction`, `GpioOperation` and `Levels` are enum classes now, which prevents
  name clashes with Windows defines.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/572
- New CMake option `FSFW_HAL_LINUX_ADD_LIBGPIOD` to specifically exclude `gpiod` code.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/572
- HAL Devicehandlers: Periodic printout is run-time configurable now
- `oneShotAction` flag in the `TestTask` class is not static anymore
- Major update for version handling, using `git describe` to fetch version information with git.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/601
  - Add helper functions provided by [`cmake-modules`](https://github.com/bilke/cmake-modules)
    manually now. Those should not change too often and only a small subset is needed
  - Separate folder for easier update and for distinction
  - LICENSE file included
  - use `int` for version numbers to allow unset or uninitialized version
  - Initialize Version object with numbers set to -1
  - Instead of hardcoding the git hash, it is now retrieved from git
  - `Version` now allows specifying additional version information like the git SHA1 hash and the
    versions since the last tag
  - Additional information is set to the last part of the git describe output for `FSFW_VERSION` now.
  - Version still need to be hand-updated if the FSFW is not included as a submodule for now.
- IPC Message Queue Handling: Allow passing an optional `MqArgs` argument into the MessageQueue
  creation call. It allows passing context information and an arbitrary user argument into
  the message queue. Also streamlined and simplified `MessageQueue` implementation for all OSALs
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/583

### Task Module Refactoring

PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/636

**Refactoring general task code**

- There was a lot of duplicate/boilerplate code inside the individual task IF OSAL implementations.
  Remove it by introducing base classes `PeriodicTaskBase` and `FixedTimeslotTaskBase`.

**Refactor PeriodicTaskIF**

- Convert `virtual ReturnValue_t addComponent(object_id_t object)` to
  `virtual ReturnValue_t addComponent(object_id_t object, uint8_t opCode = 0)`, allowing to pass
  the operation code passed to `performOperation`. Updated API taking
  an `ExecutableObjectIF` accordingly

**Refactor FixedTimeslotTaskIF**

- Add additional `addSlot` function which takes an `ExecutableObjectIF` pointer and its Object ID

**Refactor FixedSequenceSlot**

- Introduce typedef `CustomCheckFunc` for `ReturnValue_t (*customCheckFunction)(const SlotList&)`.
- Convert `ReturnValue_t (*customCheckFunction)(const SlotList&)` to
  `ReturnValue_t (*customCheckFunction)(const SlotList&, void*)`, allowing arbitrary user arguments
  for the custom checker

**Linux Task Module**

- Use composition instead of inheritance for the `PeriodicPosixTask` and make the `PosixTask` a
  member of the class

### HAL

- HAL Linux Uart: Baudrate and bits per word are enums now, avoiding misconfigurations
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/585
- HAL Linux SPI: Set the Clock Default State when setting new SPI speed
  and mode
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/573
- GPIO HAL: `Direction`, `GpioOperation` and `Levels` are enum classes now, which prevents
  name clashes with Windows defines.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/572
- HAL Linux Uart: Baudrate and bits per word are enums now, avoiding misconfigurations
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/585

### Time

PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/584 and
https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/593

- `timeval` to `TimeOfDay_t`
- Added Mutex for gmtime calls: (compare http://www.opengate.at/blog/2020/01/timeless/)
- Moved the statics used by Clock in ClockCommon.cpp to this file
- Better check for leap seconds
- Added Unittests for Clock (only getter)

### Power 

- `PowerSwitchIF`: Remove `const` specifier from `sendSwitchCommand` and `sendFuseOnCommand` and
  also specify a `ReturnValue_t` return type
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/590
- Extend `PowerSwitcher` module to optionally check current state when calling `turnOn` or
  `turnOff`. Tis can be helpful to avoid commanding switches which do not need commanding
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/590

## Removed

- Removed the `HkSwitchHelper`. This module should not be needed anymore, now that the local
  datapools have been implemented.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/557

## Additions

- Added options for CI/CD builds: `FSFW_CICD_BUILD`. This allows the source code to know
  whether it is running in CI/CD
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/623
- Basic `clion` support: Update `.gitignore` and add some basic run configurations
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/625
- LTO support: Allow using LTO/IPO by setting `FSFW_ENABLE_LTO=1`. CMake is able to detect whether
  the user compiler supports IPO/LPO. LTO is on by default now. Most modern compilers support it,
  can make good use of it and it usually makes the code faster and/or smaller.
  After some more research:
  Enabling LTO will actually cause the compiler to only produce thin LTO by adding 
  `-flto -fno-fat-lto-objects` to the compiler options. I am not sure this is an ideal choice
  because if an application linking against the FSFW does not use LTO, there can be compile
  issues (e.g. observed when compiling the FSFW tests without LTO). This is a known issue as
  can be seen in the multiple CMake issues for it: 
    - https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/22913, 
    - https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/16808, 
    - https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21696
  Easiest solution for now: Keep this option OFF by default.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/616
- Linux HAL: Add wiretapping option for I2C. Enabled with `FSFW_HAL_I2C_WIRETAPPING` defined to 1
- Dedicated Version class and constant `fsfw::FSFW_VERSION` containing version information
  inside `fsfw/version.h`
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/559
- Added generic PUS TC Scheduler Service 11. It depends on the new added Emebeded Template Library
  (ETL) dependency.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/594
- Added ETL dependency and improved library dependency management
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/592
- Add a `DummyPowerSwitcher` module which can be useful for test setups when no PCDU is available
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/590
- New typedef for switcher type
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/590
- `Subsystem`: New API to add table and sequence entries

## Fixed

  `TcpTmTcServer::handleTmSending(socket_t connSocket, bool& tmSent)` call.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/618
- Fix infinite recursion in `prepareHealthSetReply` of PUS Health Service 201.
  Is not currently used right now but might be used in the future
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/617
- Move some CMake directives further up top so they are not ignored
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/621
- Small bugfix in STM32 HAL for SPI
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/599
- HAL GPIO: Improved error checking in `LinuxLibgpioIF::configureGpios(...)`. If a GPIO
  configuration fails, the function will exit prematurely with a dedicated error code
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/602

# [v4.0.0]

## Additions

- CFDP Packet Stack and related tests added. It also refactors the existing TMTC infastructure to
  allow sending of CFDP packets to the CCSDS handlers.
  PR: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/pulls/528

Milestone: https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/fsfw/fsfw/milestone/5

# [v1.2.0]

## API Changes

### FSFW Architecture

- New src folder which contains all source files except the HAL, contributed code and test code
- External and internal API mostly stayed the same
- Folder names are now all smaller case: internalError was renamed to internalerror and
  FreeRTOS was renamed to freertos
- Warning if optional headers are used but the modules was not added to the source files to compile

### HAL

- HAL added back into FSFW. It is tightly bound to the FSFW, and compiling it as a static library
  made using it more complicated than necessary

## Bugfixes

### FreeRTOS QueueMapManager

- Fixed a bug which causes the first generated Queue ID to be invalid

## Enhancements

### FSFW Architecture

- See API changes chapter. This change will keep the internal API consistent in the future

# [v1.1.0]

## API Changes

### PUS

- Added PUS C support
- SUBSYSTEM_IDs added for PUS Services
- Added new Parameter which must be defined in config: fsfwconfig::FSFW_MAX_TM_PACKET_SIZE

### ObjectManager

 - ObjectManager is now a singelton


### Configuration

- Additional configuration option fsfwconfig::FSFW_MAX_TM_PACKET_SIZE which 
  need to be specified in FSFWConfig.h

### CMake

- Changed Cmake FSFW_ADDITIONAL_INC_PATH to FSFW_ADDITIONAL_INC_PATHS

## Bugfixes 

- timemanager/TimeStamperIF.h: Timestamp config was not used correctly, leading to different timestamp sizes than configured in fsfwconfig::FSFW_MISSION_TIMESTAMP_SIZE
- TCP server fixes

## Enhancements

### FreeRTOS Queue Handles

- Fixed an internal issue how FreeRTOS MessageQueues were handled

### Linux OSAL

- Better printf error messages

### CMake

- Check for C++11 as mininimum required Version

### Debug Output

- Changed Warning color to magenta, which is well readable on both dark and light mode IDEs


# Changes from ASTP 0.0.1 to 1.0.0

### Host OSAL

- Bugfix in MessageQueue, which caused the sender not to be set properly

### FreeRTOS OSAL

- vRequestContextSwitchFromISR is declared extern "C" so it can be defined in
a C file without issues

### PUS Services

- It is now possible to change the message queue depth for the telecommand verification service (PUS1)
- The same is possible for the event reporting service (PUS5)
- PUS Health Service added, which allows to command and retrieve health via PUS packets


### EnhancedControllerBase

- New base class for a controller which also implements HasActionsIF and HasLocalDataPoolIF

### Local Pool

- Interface of LocalPools has changed. LocalPool is not a template anymore. Instead the size and
bucket number of the pools per page and the number of pages are passed to the ctor instead of
two ctor arguments and a template parameter

### Parameter Service

- The API of the parameter service has been changed to prevent inconsistencies
between documentation and actual code and to clarify usage.
- The parameter ID now consists of:
	1. Domain ID (1 byte)
	2. Unique Identifier (1 byte)
	3. Linear Index (2 bytes)
The linear index can be used for arrays as well as matrices.
The parameter load command now explicitely expects the ECSS PTC and PFC
information as well as  the rows and column number. Rows and column will
default to one, which is equivalent to one scalar parameter (the most
important use-case)
   
### File System Interface

- A new interfaces specifies the functions for a software object which exposes the file system of
a given hardware to use message based file handling (e.g. PUS commanding)

### Internal Error Reporter

- The new internal error reporter uses the local data pools. The pool IDs for
the exisiting three error values and the new error set will be hardcoded for
now, the the constructor for the internal error reporter just takes an object
ID for now.

### Device Handler Base

- There is an additional `PERFORM_OPERATION` step for the device handler base. It is important
that DHB users adapt their polling sequence tables to perform this step. This steps allows for 
a clear distinction between operation and communication steps
- setNormalDatapoolEntriesInvalid is not an abstract method and a default implementation was provided
- getTransitionDelayMs is now an abstract method

### DeviceHandlerIF

- Typo for UNKNOWN_DEVICE_REPLY 

### Events

- makeEvent function: Now takes three input parameters instead of two and
allows setting a unique ID. Event.cpp source file removed, functions now
defined in header directly. Namespaces renamed. Functions declared `constexpr`
now

### Commanding Service Base

- CSB uses the new fsfwconfig::FSFW_CSB_FIFO_DEPTH variable to determine  the FIFO depth for each 
CSB instance. This variable has to be set in the FSFWConfig.h file

### Service Interface

- Proper printf support contained in ServiceInterfacePrinter.h
- CPP ostream support now optional (can reduce executable size by 150 - 250 kB)
- Amalagated header which determines automatically which service interface to use depending on FSFWConfig.h configuration. 
  Users can just use #include <fsfw/serviceinterface/ServiceInterface.h>
- If CPP streams are excluded, sif:: calls won't work anymore and need to be replaced by their printf counterparts. 
  For the fsfw, this can be done by checking the processor define FSFW_CPP_OSTREAM_ENABLED from FSFWConfig.h. 
  For mission code, developers need to replace sif:: calls by the printf counterparts, but only if the CPP stream are excluded. 
  If this is not the case, everything should work as usual.

### ActionHelper and ActionMessage

- ActionHelper finish function and ActionMessage::setCompletionReply now expects explicit 
information whether to report a success or failure message instead of deriving it implicitely 
from returnvalue

### PUS Parameter Service 20

Added PUS parameter service 20 (only custom subservices available).
