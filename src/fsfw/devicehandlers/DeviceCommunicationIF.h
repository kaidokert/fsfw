/**
 * @brief This is an interface to decouple device communication from
 * the device handler to allow reuse of these components.
 * @details
 * Documentation: Dissertation Baetz p.138.
 * It works with the assumption that received data  is polled by a component.
 * There are four generic steps of device communication:
 *
 *   1. Send data to a device
 *   2. Get acknowledgement for sending
 *   3. Request reading data from a device
 *   4. Read received data
 *
 *  To identify different connection over a single interface can return
 *  so-called cookies to components.
 *  The CommunicationMessage message type can be used to extend the
 *  functionality of the ComIF if a separate polling task is required.
