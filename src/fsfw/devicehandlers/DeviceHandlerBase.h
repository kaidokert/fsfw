/**
 * @brief This is the abstract base class for device handlers.
 * @details
 * Documentation: Dissertation Baetz p.138,139, p.141-149
 *
 * It features handling of @link DeviceHandlerIF::Mode_t Modes @endlink,
 * communication with physical devices, using the
 * @link DeviceCommunicationIF @endlink, and communication with commanding
 * objects. It inherits SystemObject and thus can be created by the
 * ObjectManagerIF.
 *
 * This class uses the opcode of ExecutableObjectIF to perform a
 * step-wise execution. For each step a different action is selected and
 * executed. Currently, the device handler base performs a 4-step
 * execution related to 4 communication steps (based on RMAP).
 * NOTE: RMAP is a standard which is used for Flying Laptop.
 * RMAP communication is not mandatory for projects implementing the FSFW.
 * However, the communication principles are similar to RMAP as there are
 * two write and two send calls involved.
 *
 * Device handler instances should extend this class and implement the abstract
 * functions. Components and drivers can send so called cookies which are used
 * for communication and contain information about the communcation (e.g. slave
 * address for I2C or RMAP structs).
 * The following abstract methods must be implemented by a device handler:
 *  1. doStartUp()
 *  2. doShutDown()
 *  3. buildTransitionDeviceCommand()
 *  4. buildNormalDeviceCommand()
 *  5. buildCommandFromCommand()
 *  6. fillCommandAndReplyMap()
 *  7. scanForReply()
 *  8. interpretDeviceReply()
 *
 * Other important virtual methods with a default implementation
 * are the getTransitionDelayMs() function and the getSwitches() function.
 * If a transition to MODE_ON is desired without commanding, override the
 * intialize() function and call setMode(_MODE_START_UP) before calling
 * DeviceHandlerBase::initialize().
 *
 * @ingroup devices
