/**
 *	@brief		This class is the representation and data organizer
 *				for interprocess messages.
 *	@details
 *	To facilitate and standardize interprocess communication, this class was
 *	created to handle a lightweight "interprocess message protocol".
 *
 *	It adds a header with the sender's queue id to every sent message and
 *	defines the maximum total message size. Specialized messages, such as
 *	device commanding messages, can be created by inheriting from this class
 *	and filling the buffer provided by getData with additional content.
 *
 *	If larger amounts of data must be sent between processes, the data shall
 *	be stored in the IPC Store object and only the storage id is passed in a
 *	queue message.The class is used both to generate and send messages and to
 *	receive messages from other tasks.
