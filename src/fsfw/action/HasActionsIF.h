/**
 * @brief
 * Interface for component which uses actions
 *
 * @details
 * This interface is used to execute actions in the component. Actions, in the
 * sense of this interface, are activities with a well-defined beginning and
 * end in time. They may adjust sub-states of components, but are not supposed
 * to change the main mode of operation, which is handled with the HasModesIF
 * described below.
 *
 * The HasActionsIF allows components to define such actions and make them
 * available for other components to use. Implementing the interface is
 * straightforward: Thereâ€™s a single executeAction call, which provides an
 * identifier for the action to execute, as well as arbitrary parameters for
 * input.
 * Aside from direct, software-based actions, it is used in device handler
 * components as an interface to forward commands to devices.
 * Implementing components of the interface are supposed to check identifier
 * (ID) and parameters and immediately start execution of the action.
 * It is, however, not required to immediately finish execution.
 * Instead, this may be deferred to a later point in time, at which the
 * component needs to inform the caller about finished or failed execution.
 *
 * @ingroup interfaces
