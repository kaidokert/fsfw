 * @brief	This class provides an interface to the global object manager.

 * This manager handles a list of available objects with system-wide relevance, such as device
 * handlers, and TM/TC services. They can be inserted, removed and retrieved from the list.
 * On getting the object, the call checks if the object implements the requested interface.
 * This interface does not specify a getter function because templates can't be used in interfaces.
