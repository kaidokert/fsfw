/**
 * @brief	This class implements a global object manager.
 * @details	This manager handles a list of available objects with system-wide
 * 			relevance, such as device handlers, and TM/TC services. Objects can
 * 			be inserted, removed and retrieved from the list. In addition, the
 * 			class holds a so-called factory, that creates and inserts new
 * 			objects if they are not already in the list. This feature automates
 * 			most of the system initialization.
 * 			As the system is static after initialization, no new objects are
 * 			created or inserted into the list after startup.
