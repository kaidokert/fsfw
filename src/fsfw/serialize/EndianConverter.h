/**
 * Helper class to convert variables or bitstreams between machine
 * endian and either big or little endian.
 * Machine endian is the endianness used by the machine running the
 * program and is one of big or little endian. As this is portable
 * code, it is not known at coding time which it is. At compile time
 * it is however, which is why this is implemented using compiler
 * macros and translates to a copy operation at runtime.
 *
 * This changes the layout of multi-byte variables in the machine's
 * memory. In most cases, you should not need to use this class.
 * Probably what you are looking for is the SerializeAdapter.
 * If you still decide you need this class, please read and understand
 * the code first.
 *
 * The order of the individual bytes of the multi-byte variable is
 * reversed, the byte at the highest address is moved to the lowest
 * address and vice versa, same for the bytes in between.
 *
 * Note that the conversion is also its inversion, that is converting
 * from machine to a specified endianness is the same operation as
 * converting from specified to machine (I looked it up, mathematicians
 * would call it an involution):
 *
 * X == convertBigEndian(convertBigEndian(X))
 *
 * Thus, there is only one function supplied to do the conversion.
