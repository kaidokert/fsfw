/**
 * @brief Report on-board events like information or errors
 * @details
 * Full Documentation: ECSS-E70-41A p.79
 * Implements the PusServiceBase template class.
 * Documentation: Dissertation Baetz p.135,136
 *
 * This service provides for the reporting to the service user of information of
 * operational significance.
 *   1. reporting of failures or anomalies detected on-board;
 *   2. reporting of autonomous on-board actions;
 *   3. reporting of normal progress of operations and activities, e.g.
 *   detection of events which are not anomalous (such as payload events),
 *   reaching of predefined steps in an operation. Some reports can combine
 *   more than one of these events.
 *
 * Minimum capabilities of this service:
 *
 * - TM[5,1]: Normal/Progress Report
 * - TM[5,2]: Error/Anomaly Report - Low Severity
 * - TM[5,3]: Error/Anomaly Report - Medium Severity
 * - TM[5,4]: Error/Anomaly Report - High Severity
 *
 * Events can be translated by using translator files located in
 * /config/objects/ and /config/events/. Description to events can be added by
 * adding a comment behind the event definition with [//!<] as leading string
 *
 * Additional capabilities of this service:
 *
 *  - TC[5,5]: Enable Event Report Generation (Req. 6)
 *  - TC[5,6]: Disable Event Report Generation (Req. 5)
