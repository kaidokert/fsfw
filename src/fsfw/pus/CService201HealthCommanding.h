/**
 * @brief   Custom PUS service to set health of all objects
 *          implementing hasHealthIF.
 *
 * Examples: Device Handlers, Assemblies or Subsystems.
 * Full Documentation: ECSS-E-ST-70-41C or ECSS-E-70-41A
 * Dissertation Baetz p. 115, 116, 165-167.
 *
 * This is a gateway service. It relays device commands using the software bus.
 * This service is very closely tied to the Commanding Service Base template
 * class. There is constant interaction between this Service Base und a
 * child class like this service
 *
