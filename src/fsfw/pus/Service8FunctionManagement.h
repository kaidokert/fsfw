/**
 * @brief Functional commanding.
 * Full Documentation: ECSS-E-ST-70-41C p.64, p. 451
 * Dissertation Baetz p. 115, 116, 165-167
 *
 * This service provides the capability to perform functions of an
 * application process and provides high-level commanding as opposed to the
 * Raw Access provided by Service 2. Examples for these functions can include
 * control and operation of payload or the AOCS subsystem.
 * This service will be the primary means to control the spacecraft as it is
 * considered safer than the Raw Access provided
 * by Service 2 and is generally sufficient for most tasks.
 *
 * This is a gateway service. It relays device commands using the software bus.
 * This service is very closely tied to the Commanding Service Base template
 * class. There is constant interaction between this Service Base und a
 * subclass like this service.
 *
 * Service Capability:
 * 	 - TC[8,128]: Direct Commanding
 *   - TM[8,130]: Direct Commanding Data Reply
 *
