/**
 * @brief		This class manages sending and receiving of
 * 				message queue messages.
 * @details
 * Message queues are used to pass asynchronous messages between processes.
 * They work like post boxes, where all incoming messages are stored in FIFO
 * order. This class creates a new receiving queue and provides methods to fetch
 * received messages. Being a child of MessageQueueSender, this class also
 * provides methods to send a message to a user-defined or a default destination.
 * In addition it also provides a reply method to answer to the queue it
 * received its last message from.
 *
 * The MessageQueue should be used as "post box" for a single owning object.
 * So all message queue communication is "n-to-one".
 * For creating the queue, as well as sending and receiving messages, the class
 * makes use of the operating system calls provided.
 *
 * Please keep in mind that FreeRTOS offers different calls for message queue
 * operations if called from an ISR.
 * For now, the system context needs to be switched manually.
 * @ingroup osal
