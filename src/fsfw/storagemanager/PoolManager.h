/**
 * @brief	The PoolManager class provides an intermediate data storage with
 * 			a fixed pool size policy for inter-process communication.
 * @details
 * Uses local pool calls but is thread safe by protecting most calls
 * with a lock. The developer can lock the pool with the provided API
 * if the lock needs to persists beyond the function call.
 *
 * Other than that, the class provides the same interface as the LocalPool
 * class. The class is always registered as a system object as it is assumed
 * it will always be used concurrently (if this is not the case, it is
 * recommended to use the LocalPool class instead).
