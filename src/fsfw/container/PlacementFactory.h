/**
 * The Placement Factory is used to create objects at runtime in a specific pool.
 * In general, this should be avoided and it should only be used if you know what you are doing.
 * You are not allowed to use this container with a type that allocates memory internally like
 * ArrayList.
 *
 * Also, you have to check the returned pointer in generate against nullptr!
 *
 * A backend of Type StorageManagerIF must be given as a place to store the new objects.
 * Therefore ThreadSafety is only provided by your StorageManager Implementation.
 *
 * Objects must be destroyed by the user with "destroy"! Otherwise the pool will not be cleared.
 *
 * The concept is based on the placement new operator.
 *
 * @warning Do not use with any Type that allocates memory internally!
