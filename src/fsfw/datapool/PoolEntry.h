/**
 * @brief	This is a small helper class that defines a single data pool entry.
 * @details
 * The helper is used to store all information together with the data as a
 * single data pool entry. The content's type is defined by the template
 * argument.
 *
 * It is prepared for use with plain old data types, but may be
 * extended to complex types if necessary. It can be initialized with a
 * certain value, size and validity flag.
 *
 * It holds a pointer to the real data and offers methods to access this data
 * and to acquire additional information (such as validity and array/byte size).
 * It is NOT intended to be used outside DataPool implementations as it performs
 * dynamic memory allocation.
