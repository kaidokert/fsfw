/**
 * @brief	The DataSetBase class manages a set of locally checked out variables.
 * @details
 * This class manages a list, where a set of local variables (or pool variables)
 * are registered. They are checked-out (i.e. their values are looked
 * up and copied) with the read call. After the user finishes working with the
 * pool variables, he can write back all variable values to the pool with
 * the commit call. The data set manages locking and freeing the data pool,
 * to ensure that all values are read and written back at once.
 *
 * An internal state manages usage of this class. Variables may only be
 * registered before the read call is made, and the commit call only
 * after the read call.
 *
 * If pool variables are writable and not committed until destruction
 * of the set, the DataSet class automatically sets the valid flag in the
 * data pool to invalid (without) changing the variable's value.
 *
 * The base class lockDataPool und unlockDataPool implementation are empty
 * and should be implemented to protect the underlying pool type.
