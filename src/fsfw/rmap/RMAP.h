/**
 * API for a Cookie/Channel based RMAP implementation.
 *
 * The API offers the four basic RMAP actions: sending a Read or Write command and getting the reply
 * to each. As RMAP is an asynchronous protocol, these are implemented as four seperate calls. There
 * are blocking calls which combine a send and get call using a timeout, but these are "real"
 * blocking, looping in between the calls.
 *
 * Cookies are used to contain Information between a send[Read,Write]Command and a
 * get[Read,Write]Reply call, one can think of them like *nix file descriptors. A cookie is valid
 * from a sendX call until the related getX call. That means if a cookie is used in a getX call, the
 * reply to the sendX call the cookie was used with previously is returned. Depending on the
 * underlying RMAPChannel implementation, a cookie can also be valid for more than one getX call,
 * but this should not be assumed generally. A cookie encapsulates information like the RMAP Channel
 * to use, as well as the RMAP Address and a Command Mask used for specifying which RMAP
 * capabilities are used. Cookies are created without interaction with this API, there is no open()
 * call. The RMAP implementation will initialize all fields which are not set by the cookie's
 * constructor.
 *
 * The RMAP implementation relies on Channels. A channel is used to construct the RMAP Headers and
 * handle the protocol. It is access via the RMAPChannelIF. Thus it is possible to use different
 * Implementations which only need to implement the RMAPChannelIF. A channel is also responsible for
 * accessing the lower layers, for example a SPaceWire transport layer.
 *
 * There is one RMAP Channel per physical device. The cookie-channel as well as the device-channel
 * assignment can be changed at runtime to allow for example redundancy switching. This API is
 * static as the information which channel to use is contained within the cookie.
