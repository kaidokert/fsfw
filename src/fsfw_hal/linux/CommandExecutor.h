 * @brief   Helper class to execute shell commands in blocking and non-blocking mode
 * @details
 * This class is able to execute processes by using the Linux popen call. It also has the
 * capability of writing the read output of a process into a provided ring buffer.
 *
 * The executor works by first loading the command which should be executed and specifying
 * whether it should be executed blocking or non-blocking. After that, execution can be started
 * with the execute command. In blocking mode, the execute command will block until the command
 * has finished
